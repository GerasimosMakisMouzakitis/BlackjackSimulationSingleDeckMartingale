# Blackjack Simulation with Martingale Betting Strategy

A Python simulation of Blackjack using a single deck with the Martingale betting system to analyze the effectiveness and risks of this popular gambling strategy.

## Overview

This simulation implements a complete Blackjack game with the following features:
- Single deck (52 cards) with automatic reshuffling when cards run low
- Standard Blackjack rules with proper Ace handling
- Martingale betting strategy implementation
- Detailed round-by-round tracking and statistics

## Game Rules

### Blackjack Rules
- **Player Strategy**: Hits on hand value â‰¤ 16, stands on 17+
- **Dealer Strategy**: Hits until reaching at least 17 (soft 17 stands)
- **Card Values**: Number cards (2-10) = face value, Face cards (J,Q,K) = 10, Ace = 11 or 1 (whichever is better)
- **Winning Conditions**: 
  - Player wins if dealer busts or player's hand is closer to 21
  - Dealer wins if player busts or dealer's hand is closer to 21
  - Push (tie) if both hands have equal value

### Martingale Betting Strategy
- Start with a base bet of 1 unit
- **After a loss**: Double the bet for the next round
- **After a win**: Reset bet to 1 unit
- **After a push**: Keep the same bet amount

## Features

- **Automatic Deck Management**: Reshuffles when fewer than 15 cards remain
- **Bankroll Tracking**: Starts with 100 units, tracks gains/losses
- **Loss Streak Monitoring**: Configurable stopping condition based on consecutive losses
- **Detailed Output**: Round-by-round breakdown showing bet amount, outcome, bankroll, and loss streak

## Installation

No external dependencies required. The simulation uses only Python standard library modules:
- `random` (for deck shuffling)
- `collections.deque` (for efficient deck operations)

## Usage

Run the simulation:

```bash
python blackjack_martingale.py
```

You'll be prompted to enter the maximum number of consecutive losses before the simulation stops. Enter a positive integer or press Enter to use the default value of 5.

### Example Output

```
Simulation Rules:
- Player hits when hand value is 16 or less; stands on 17 and above.
- Dealer hits until reaching at least 17 (soft 17 stands).
- Martingale betting: double your bet after a loss, repeat bet on push, reset to 1 on win.
- Simulation stops after 5 consecutive losses or when bankroll hits zero.

Starting bankroll: 100 units

Round  1 | Bet =   1 | Outcome = WIN  | Bankroll =  101 | Loss Streak = 0
Round  2 | Bet =   1 | Outcome = LOSE | Bankroll =  100 | Loss Streak = 1
Round  3 | Bet =   2 | Outcome = WIN  | Bankroll =  102 | Loss Streak = 0
Round  4 | Bet =   1 | Outcome = PUSH | Bankroll =  102 | Loss Streak = 0
Round  5 | Bet =   1 | Outcome = LOSE | Bankroll =  101 | Loss Streak = 1
...

Simulation ended.
Final bankroll: 95 units
Total rounds played: 23
```

## Key Insights

This simulation helps demonstrate:
1. **Martingale Limitations**: Even with a "winning" strategy, consecutive losses can quickly deplete bankroll
2. **Risk vs. Reward**: Small frequent wins vs. potential large losses
3. **Bankroll Requirements**: The exponential growth of bet sizes during losing streaks
4. **Statistical Reality**: House edge persists regardless of betting strategy

## Customization

You can modify the simulation by adjusting:
- **Starting bankroll**: Change `starting_bankroll` in the `simulate()` function
- **Base bet amount**: Modify the initial `bet = 1` value
- **Player strategy**: Update the `play_player()` function logic
- **Deck size**: Modify `create_deck()` for multiple decks
- **Reshuffling threshold**: Change the `< 15` cards condition
